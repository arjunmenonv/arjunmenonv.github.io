Hi There! I am an undergrad from the Electrical Engineering department in IIT Madras. I am passionate about Computer Architecture, Digital VLSI Design and High Performance Computing. I enjoy circuit design in general (both analog and digital) and love playing with signal processing systems. This webpage is mainly intended as an informal exercise for me to express my thoughts and share interesting ideas, primarily from my fields of interest. I believe such an exercise will help me keep track of trends in these domains.

I grew up for the most part in Bangalore (don't worry, I am not here to talk about Bangalore's weather, tech culture or how bad the traffic at Silk Board Jn was this morning). I can think in English, Malayalam and in the Frequency Domain, and speak Hindi and Time Domain. Tamil konjam-konjam theriyum and Kannada gothilla.
