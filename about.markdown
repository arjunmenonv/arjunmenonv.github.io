TO BE REFINED

Hi There! I am an undergrad in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. My interests include Circuit Design and System Implementation with special focus on digital design using FPGAs, and circuit design for domains such as Deep Learning and Communication Systems. 

I am inherently curious about the mysteries of our universe, and hence I am passionate about modelling systems (scientific method) and implementing them (engineering approach). Apart from STEM, I enjoy listening to rock, heavy metal and Carnatic music, with some of my favourite rock artists being Iron Maiden, Pink Floyd and Slash.

I grew up for the most part in the wonderful city of Bangalore (don't worry, I won't talk about Bangalore's weather or traffic here). I can speak English, Malayalam and Hindi. Tamil konjam konjam theriyum and Kannada gothilla.
